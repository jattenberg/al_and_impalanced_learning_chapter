From Dr.~Jay Young, consultant from Silver Spring, Maryland, I received
the initial push to even consider writing this book. Jay was a constant
``peer reader'' and very welcome advisor durying this year-long process.

\introduction
The era of modern \inx{microelectronics}\inxx{microelectronics,modern}
began in 1958 with the invention of the
integrated circuit by J. S. Kilby\inxx{Kilby\, J. S.}
 of Texas Instruments.\cite{kilby}
His first chip is shown in Fig.~I. For comparison,
Fig. I.2~shows a modern microprocessor chip, \cite{beren}.
