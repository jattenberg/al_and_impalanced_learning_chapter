\noindent\textbf{Abstract}

Please include an Abstract for your chapter. Here is just an example...

The ubiquitous imbalanced class distribution occurred in real world data sets has
excited considerable interests in the study of imbalanced learning. However it
is still a relatively uncharted area when it is nonstationary data stream with imbalanced
class distribution that needs to be processed. Difficulties in this case
are generally two-fold. First, dynamically structured learning framework is required
to catch up with the evolution of unstable class concepts, i.e., concept drifts.
Second, imbalanced class distribution over data stream demands a mechanism to
intensify the underrepresented class concepts for improved overall performance.
For instance, in order to design an intelligent spam filtering system, one needs
to not only make the system to be capable of self-tuning its learning parameters
to keep pace with the rapid evolution of spam mail patterns, but also the system
has to tackle the fundamental problem that in some situations normal emails
are severely outnumbered by spam emails, but it is so much more expensive to
misclassify a normal email into spam, e.g., confirmation of a business contract,
than the other way around. This chapter introduces learning algorithms that were
specifically proposed to tackle the problem of learning from nonstationary data set
with imbalanced class distribution. System-level principle and framework of these
methods are described in algorithmic level, the soundness of which are furthered
validated through theoretical analysis as well as simulations on both synthetic and
real-world benchmarks with varied level of imbalanced ratio and noise level.
